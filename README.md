## Project Overview
This project demonstrates simulation of development and testing of WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR CITY BANSKA STIAVNICA. 
For example a Location of Containers.
The focus is on Creating User stories, Tasks, in general Agile "evolution".
Inside this "Agile World" I have focused on API testing using Postman and JSON server mock data.

### INSIDE THE POSTMAN ENVIRONMENT - FAKE (MOCK SERVER - JSON SERVER) API Testing 
- Using Postman for sending HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) ON FICTIONAL SERVER.
- RestFul API METHODS :
                - GET (GETTING LIST OF ALL CONTAINERS)
                  (LINK NA SCREENSHOT)
                -PM.TEST
                - POST (CREATING A NEW LOCATION OF CONTAINER)
                   (LINK NA SCREENSHOT)
                   -PM.TEST
                - PUT (UPDATE EXISTING LOCATION OF CONTAINER)
                   (LINK NA SCREENSHOT)
                   -PM.TEST
                - DELETE (ERASING OF EXISTING LOCATION OF CONTAINER)
                   (LINK NA SCREENSHOT)
                    -PM.TEST
  Json - Postman COLLECTION
  Json - Mock Fake Data - on Json.server
  



## Project Goals
- Effectively monitor the waste management situation.
- Establish an efficient monitoring mechanism for the waste situation from the perspective of the Department of Sanitation employees.
- Implement agile management and control in the city's waste sector.
- The core of the system is a localization map of Banska Stiavnica, featuring a live tracking mode for waste collection vehicles.
