## Project Goals
- Effectively monitor the waste management situation.
- Establish an efficient monitoring mechanism for the waste situation from the perspective of the Department of Sanitation employees.
- Implement agile management and control in the city's waste sector.
- The core of the system is a localization map of Banska Stiavnica, featuring a live tracking mode for waste collection vehicles.
